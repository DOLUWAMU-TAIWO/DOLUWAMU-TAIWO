# Welcome to My GitHub! 

üåü **Electronics Engineer | System Architect | Innovator | Quantum Engineer**

I am an Electronics Engineer driven by a passion for designing systems that are both powerful and efficient. I studied in Germany at the University of Hamm, where I explored and excelled in topics like cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and processor architecture (RISC-V).

During my academic journey, I was introduced to programming languages like **C++**, **Python**, and **Java**, which became essential tools in my engineering projects. My passion for innovation led me to develop cutting-edge systems, including autonomous smart vehicles, traffic management systems, and modular RISC-V processors on FPGAs. 

With a commitment to excellence and innovation, I continue to bridge technical expertise and creativity to tackle real-world challenges and create impactful solutions.


## üõ†Ô∏è My Journey
- **Thesis Achievement**: Integrated and implemented RISC-V processors on FPGAs, working at the bare-metal level to create customized drivers and run diverse applications.
- **Verification & Validation**: Used UPPAAL to ensure system reliability and efficiency.
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Built a Unity-based application/game to simulate efficient building designs using C#.

## üí° Professional Experience
While balancing academics, I worked as a **working student** and was later promoted to **project leader** at an IT and networking company. Here, I honed my skills in distributed systems, AV, and IT, leading large-scale engineering projects. I later founded **Qorelabs**, where I deliver innovative software solutions across disciplines.

## üåå My Vision <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> 
As a leader, I am passionate about creating systems that are both powerful and efficient. I leverage my strong foundation in **distributed systems, CI/CD, backend development**, and intuitive frontend design to drive excellence in every project. My machine learning journey was fueled by a natural affinity for mathematics and probabilities, leading to three research papers on algorithms.

My dreams are boundless‚ÄîI aspire to drive the **quantum engineering wave** and make a tangible difference through groundbreaking innovations.
